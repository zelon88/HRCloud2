This document provides guidelines for contributing to the HRCloud2 project.

--MOST NEEDED--
Currently, HRCloud2 needs front-end elements improved and GUI's added to support specialty 
and mobile devices. In addition to GUI elements, HRCloud2 also needs "Automatic Indexer" 
contributions to redirect certain devices to specific index pages.

--WE WELCOME--
Anything you have to offer! Advice, complaints, feature requests, code improvements, 
whatever you've got, we want to hear it.

--WE WILL CONSIDER--
Any contribution which adds value and/or convinience to the platform.

--WE WILL NOT CONSIDER-- 
Any contribution that requires a connection to external or 3rd party servers or services. 
This includes Google Cloud, AWS, or any other PaaS or SaaS service that cannot be
included as a local dependency. 

--NICE TO HAVE--
Any App that can be ported to HRCloud2 would grealy boost it's usefullness and userbase.
Bug fixes, performance and security improvements, feature additions.
